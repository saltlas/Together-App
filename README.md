# Together hiring assessment

Dataset downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset

Graph code adapted from "Dash app with multiple inputs" on this page: https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks

# Quickstart

## Running the app
- Clone the repository
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from command line
- Run `python main.py` from command line
- Navigate to the link shown on the terminal ("Dash is running on [link]")

## Using the app

You may either filter by country or by hashtag. Obviously the dataset in question is very small compared to the reality of social media post numbers, so the hashtag function is more of a proof of concept than something that can give interesting insights on this particular dataset. Hover over a node (representing a social media post) to see its values, including the sentiment of the post.
